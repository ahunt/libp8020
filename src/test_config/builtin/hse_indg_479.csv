# HSE INDG 479
# INDG 479: https://www.hse.gov.uk/pubns/indg479.pdf
# Note: this replaced the older HSE OC282/28:
# https://www.fit2fit.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/282_28.pdf
# Some sources still refer to OC 282/28, and it appears that the protocols are
# unchanged (other aspects of the guidance may have changed).
# Both speicfy at least 60s in-mask sample time per exercise, other
# values are not formally specified (therefore the values used for OSHA tests
# are used here).
# Note: the HSE protocol specifies riding an exercise bike, running on a
# treadmill, or performing a stepping exercise.
# The Fit2Fit companion contains further details:
